Problem is implement a restaurant management system.
Using this program to manage the restaurant in an organized way.

My solution approach is make a program to manage table, employers, waiters, stock items.
I use classes, objects, getters and setters, constructors, encapsulation and a lot of methods.
There are 5 class in my code. Assignment2 class namely main class, employer class, stock class,
waiter class, table class.

Main class include File I/O first of all, then I split input text files line by line and sends 
them according by their content to my other classes.

Employer class have addTable class to create Table object and put that in employertableobject arraylist.

Stock class is simply meal object. That objects array in main class, (mealobjects)

Waiter class is also waiter object. That object array in main class, (waiterobjects)

Finally table class have methods of addToOrderItemTimes to count items, addingOrderToOwnTable to
add_order command process, lastly addOrderToOwnTable to new_order command process.
